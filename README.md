## Serie 1 Problem
### File Ordering
It was intended to develop an app that allowed us to order data from several sorted files and creating a file with all the output.

The problem is described as:
* A set F = {f1, f2, ..., fn} of n files;
* Each file line has k words seperated be space.
* The files are to be ordered by the ith wword of each line.

The purpose of the app is to create a new file, sorted by the ith word in each line containing all the data of all the files.
  
## Serie 2 Problem
### Stock Exchange
It was intended to develop an app that allwoed us to manage the stocks. Selling stocks, buying and other actions.

The objective of the exercise was to implement a generic Priority Queue.

## Serie 3 Problem
### Alphabetic Order
It was intended to implement an app that allowed us to infer an alphabethic order,
if possible, given a determined set of written words in that language.

The app needs to be given the path of the file with the characters that define the alphabet
and the path of the file with the set of words of the new language.

The app has three commands:
* `anOrder?` -> Lists the order of the characteres in the new alphabet.
* `relativeOrder? word1 word2` -> Given two words, it discovers the order of them in the new alphabet.
* `e`-> Exits the application.
